Before getting started, we highly recommend reading through xavier's documentation.</p> <p>The <code>xavier</code> pipeline is composed several inter-related sub commands to setup and run the pipeline across different systems. Each of the available sub commands perform different functions:</p> <ul> <li><code>xavier run</code>: Run the XAVIER pipeline with your input files.</li> <li><code>xavier unlock</code>: Unlocks a previous runs output directory.</li> <li><code>xavier cache</code>: Cache remote resources locally, coming soon!</li> </ul> <p>XAVIER is a comprehensive whole exome-sequencing pipeline following the Broad's set of best practices. It relies on technologies like Singularity<sup>1</sup> to maintain the highest-level of reproducibility. The pipeline consists of a series of data processing and quality-control steps orchestrated by Snakemake<sup>2</sup>, a flexible and scalable workflow management system, to submit jobs to a cluster or cloud provider.</p> <p>The pipeline is compatible with data generated from Illumina short-read sequencing technologies. As input, it accepts a set of FastQ or BAM files and can be run locally on a compute instance, on-premise using a cluster, or on the cloud (feature coming soon!). A user can define the method or mode of execution. The pipeline can submit jobs to a cluster using a job scheduler like SLURM, or run on AWS using Tibanna (feature coming soon!). A hybrid approach ensures the pipeline is accessible to all users.</p> <p>Before getting started, we highly recommend reading through the usage section of each available sub command.</p> <p>For more information about issues or trouble-shooting a problem, please checkout our FAQ prior to opening an issue on Github.</p>"},{"location":"#dependencies","title":"Dependencies","text":"<p>Requires: <code>singularity&gt;=3.5</code> <code>snakemake==6.X</code></p> <p>Snakemake and singularity must be installed on the target system.
